# microprocessor-systems

**Microprocessor-systems** collects specialised code for microprocessor systems for academic use. You can find basic exercises or more specialised labs. The `ATmega640` microprocessor of the *AVR-family* has been used for testing code using `Microchip Studio`.

## Motivation

This compilation has three main objectives:

- To provide a quick introduction to the world of microprocessor systems and low-level programming.
- To group useful code that can serve as an example in basic microprocessor programming.
- To bring together all the material offered on microprocessor programming in the Microprocessor Systems course.

## Contents

The next respository has two main folders, each for a different programming language. [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search)).
