# microprocessor-systems

**Microprocessor-systems** collects specialised code for microprocessor systems for academic use. You can find basic exercises or more specialised labs. The `ATmega640` microprocessor of the *AVR-family* has been used for testing code using `Microchip Studio`.

## Motivation

This compilation has three main objectives:

- To provide a quick introduction to the world of microprocessor systems and low-level programming.
- To group useful code that can serve as an example in basic microprocessor programming.
- To bring together all the material offered on microprocessor programming in the Microprocessor Systems course.

## Contents

The next respository has two main folders, each for a different programming language. Within each folder you can find basic examples properly labelled and more specialised code files (starting with the word 'lab').

Most of the exercises and code solutions have been provided by Yago Tarroja and Jorge Portilla, professors at the Technical University of Madrid at the electronic engineering department ([DIE](http://www.upmdie.etsii.upm.es/)).
